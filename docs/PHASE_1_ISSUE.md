# Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup

## Overview
This issue tracks the completion of Phase 1 of the ZohoSync project, which establishes the foundational architecture and core components for a secure Zoho WorkDrive sync client for Linux.

## Scope
Phase 1 focuses on setting up the project infrastructure, basic authentication, core modules, and initial synchronization capabilities. This provides a solid foundation for subsequent phases.

## Deliverables

### ✅ Project Structure & Build System
- [x] Complete Go module structure with `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/` organization
- [x] Makefile with build targets for CLI, GUI, and daemon applications
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [x] Comprehensive `.gitignore` and project documentation

### ✅ Authentication & Security
- [x] OAuth 2.0 client implementation with PKCE support
- [x] Secure token storage and validation
- [x] Automatic token refresh mechanism
- [x] Local HTTP server for OAuth callback handling

### ✅ Core Architecture
- [x] Configuration management with YAML support
- [x] SQLite database layer for local storage
- [x] Comprehensive logging system
- [x] Type definitions for all core data structures

### ✅ API Client
- [x] Zoho WorkDrive REST API client
- [x] File operations: list, download, upload, delete
- [x] Folder operations and metadata retrieval
- [x] Upload session management for large files
- [x] Proper error handling and retry logic

### ✅ Synchronization Engine
- [x] File system monitoring with fsnotify
- [x] Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
- [x] MD5 hash-based change detection
- [x] Concurrent processing with configurable limits
- [x] Periodic sync scheduling

### ✅ User Interfaces
- [x] **CLI Application**: Complete command-line interface with:
  - `login` - OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
  - `status` - Sync status and statistics
  - `sync` - Manual synchronization trigger
  - `list` - Remote file listing
  - `version` - Application version info

- [x] **GUI Application**: Desktop interface with:
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication dialog
  - Main window with sync status
  - System tray integration with notifications
  - Background operation support

### ✅ System Integration
- [x] System tray integration for background operation
- [x] Desktop notifications for sync events
- [x] Automatic startup and daemon mode support
- [x] Linux desktop integration features

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Highlights
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ for performance and cross-platform support
- **GUI Framework**: Fyne v2.4+ for modern, native Linux desktop integration
- **Database**: SQLite for local data persistence
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for enterprise-grade security
- **Monitoring**: fsnotify for real-time file system change detection

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive error handling throughout all modules
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Type-safe interfaces and data structures
- Concurrent-safe operations with proper synchronization
- Extensive documentation and code comments

### Security Features
- No local storage of credentials
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for OAuth security
- Token validation and automatic refresh
- Secure local database storage

## Testing & Validation

### Build Validation
```bash
# Verify all components build successfully
make build

# Run tests (when available)
make test

# Check code quality
make lint
```

### Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test CLI authentication
./zohosync-cli login

# Verify token storage
./zohosync-cli status
```

### GUI Testing
```bash
# Launch GUI application
./zohosync

# Verify authentication flow and main window functionality
```

## Phase 1 Completion Criteria

- [x] All core modules implemented and functional
- [x] CLI and GUI applications working with basic features
- [x] OAuth 2.0 authentication flow complete
- [x] File system monitoring operational
- [x] Basic synchronization engine working
- [x] System tray integration functional
- [x] Project builds without errors
- [x] Documentation complete
