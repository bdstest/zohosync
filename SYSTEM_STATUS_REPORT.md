# System Status Report
**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**System:** mvp-inv-status

## Current System Overview

### Docker Containers Status
```
Running Containers:
- inventory_haproxy    : UP (9 days)    - HAProxy load balancer
- inventory_postgres   : UP (11 days)   - PostgreSQL database  
- inventory_grafana    : UP (10 days)   - Grafana monitoring (port 27001)
- inventory_prometheus : UP (10 days)   - Prometheus metrics (port 27002)
- inventory_redis      : UP (12 days)   - Redis cache (healthy)

Stopped Containers:
- inventory_nginx      : EXITED (10 days ago) - Nginx web server
- mock-api            : REMOVED - ZohoSync mock API server
```

### System Services
- **Nginx Service:** Inactive (dead) since July 8, 2025
  - Last active for 10 minutes 47 seconds
  - Exited successfully (status=0)
  - Service is enabled but not running

### Network Configuration
- Docker networks recently pruned due to subnet exhaustion
- Ports in use:
  - 27001: Grafana dashboard
  - 27002: Prometheus metrics
  - 8090: Was allocated for mock WorkDrive API

### Active Projects

#### 1. ZohoSync (Current Focus)
- **Location:** `/opt/zohosync`
- **Status:** Phase 1 complete, awaiting Zoho API access
- **Components:**
  - 2,100+ lines of Go code
  - OAuth integration working
  - Mock API server for testing
  - CLI and GUI applications
  - Security scanning configured

#### 2. Inventory System
- **Status:** Partially running
  - Database (PostgreSQL) operational
  - Cache (Redis) healthy
  - Monitoring (Grafana/Prometheus) active
  - Web server (Nginx) DOWN
  - Load balancer (HAProxy) running
- **Issue:** Nginx container exited, system nginx service inactive

### Resource Usage
- Multiple Go module downloads completed
- Go 1.21.5 installed at `/usr/local/go`
- Docker containers using minimal resources

## Identified Issues

### Critical
1. **Nginx Down:** Both container and system service inactive
   - Inventory system web interface likely inaccessible
   - May affect other web-based services

### Non-Critical
1. **ZohoSync Mock API:** Not running (container removed)
2. **Docker Network:** Previously exhausted, now cleaned

## Recommendations for Project Pivot

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Inventory System Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Restart nginx container
   docker start inventory_nginx
   
   # Option 2: Start system nginx service
   systemctl start nginx
   ```

2. **System Health Check:**
   - Verify all inventory system components
   - Check application logs
   - Ensure database connectivity

3. **ZohoSync Handoff:**
   - Progress report created: `ZOHOSYNC_PROGRESS_REPORT.md`
   - All code committed to GitHub
   - Awaiting Zoho support for API access
   - Can be resumed once scopes enabled

### Project Status Summary:
- **ZohoSync:** Development complete, blocked on external dependency
- **Inventory System:** Requires nginx restart for full functionality
- **System Resources:** Adequate, no immediate concerns

### Next Project Considerations:
Ready to pivot to other projects once:
1. Nginx/inventory system issue resolved
2. ZohoSync documentation reviewed
3. New project requirements provided
